# MDB: This is what a real MorphyLib interface should look like. It is much
# simpler than what is being attempted. If we want to can some of the
# more time-intensive tasks inside of some C code, we can do that. But
# as it stands, the existing C-R interface for Morphy is attempting too
# many things within the body of one function. Let the user initiate a 
# Morphy session in R, then add dimensions, raw data, symbols, and any
# other parameters they wish. They should be able to do all of this in 
# R through these bindings. If, for instance, we then want to write a 
# function that calculates the length of a tree, we can do that with R by
# any number of designs we choose. We could iterate over the tree in R, 
# but calculating the length by calling only MorphyLib functions. 
#
# If we want to can the iteration over the nodes in C, we can write some C
# to do this, but it doesn't need a giant 5-argument function that tries
# to do everything in one go. It just needs 2: the tree and the Morphy 
# object that was initialised in R through the functions below.
