To use these bindings, you need to build RMorphyex.c on your system. The 
easiest thing to do is build the Morphy library as an archive for static 
linkage (that's automatically done by the supplied Makefile in the root 
directory).

You should have a resultant file called 'libmorphy_<systemdetails>.a'. The
.a file is just an archive of the loaded object files.

Then you run:

`R CMD SHLIB -o RMorphyex.so RMorphyex.c RMorphyUtils.c /Path/To/lib/libmorphy_<systemdetails>.a`

That should build the shared library that R will be happy with.

The R wrappers for the C wrappers can then be found in Morphyex.R
